## Directory Architecture
- <strong>lib/bloc/</strong>: This directory is responsible for BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture implementation. BLoCs help separate UI logic from business logic, promoting a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

- <strong>lib/models/</strong>: This directory contains the data models used in the application. These models represent entities like anime, trailers, images, and search arguments. Organizing models in a separate directory helps keep the data layer organized and manageable.

- <strong>lib/presentation/</strong>: This directory containts all the UI-related files.

- <strong>lib/services/</strong>: Here lies the service layer of the application. Separating services from presentation logic makes it easier to test and maintain.

- <strong>lib/utils/constants/</strong>: This directory holds constant values used throughout the application such as colors, sizes, and string constants.

- <strong>lib/utils/theme</strong>: This directory contains all the theme related stuff. All the data in it is constant.
